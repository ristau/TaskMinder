# Pre-work - *TaskMinder*

**TaskMinder** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Barbara Ristau**

Time spent: **22** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list

## Notes
Challenges: 1) I'm completely new to android, so needed to invest a lot of time to familiarize myself with both Java and the platform.
2) I completed the persistence requirements as outlined, but am currently facing some snags with SQLite, expected to resolve these items shortly.
